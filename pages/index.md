**Acoustid** is an open source project that aims to create a
free database of audio fingerprints with mapping to the [MusicBrainz][5]
metadata database and provide a [web service][6] for audio file
identification using this database.

The content of the database is all submitted by users. If you have a
MusicBraiz-tagged music collection, you can help by downloading our
[submission tool][4] and letting it to analyze your audio files.

All software components are open source, so if you are a developer
interested in the project, you can download the source code for the
[client library][3], the [server application][2] and also the [database][1]
itself.
