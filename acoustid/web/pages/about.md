Title: About the AcoustID project

AcoustID is a project providing complete audio identification service,
based entirely on open source software.

It consists of a [client library](/chromaprint) for generating
compact fingerprints from audio files, a large crowd-sourced
[database of audio fingerprints](/database), many of which are linked
to the [MusicBrainz][mb] metadata
database using their [unique identifiers][mbid], and an [web service](/webservice)
that enables applications to quickly search in the fingerprint database.
