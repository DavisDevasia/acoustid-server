Title: Welcome to AcoustID!

AcoustID is a project providing complete audio identification
service, based entirely on open source software.

It that consists of a [client library][chromaprint] for generating
compact fingerprints from audio files, a large crowd-sourced
[database of audio fingerprints][db], many of which are linked
to the [MusicBrainz][mb] metadata
database using their [unique identifiers][mbid], and an [web service][webservice]
that enables applications to quickly search in the fingerprint database.

All software components used in AcoustID are open source and the
entire database can be downloaded and used with very little
restrictions (we just ask that you contribute any improvements back).
The audio identification service can be used by non-commercial
applications for free.

<p>
If you have an unknown music file, one of the applications using
AcoustID will very likely be able to tell you what song is it,
who wrote it, and a lot more. In case AcoustID doesn't recognize
the song yet, you can submit it to the database, so that the next
person trying to identify the same song will have more luck.
